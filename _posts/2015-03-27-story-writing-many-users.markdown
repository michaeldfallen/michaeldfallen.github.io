There’s a problem with the “As a user...” that never sit right with me. Who is
the user? What defines a User? I think there's too much focus only on the typical
User, the person sitting in front of a browser [registering to vote], or
[viewing their Driving License], etc.

I don’t agree.

I define a User as: “someone who will use a product of our teams work to do
something”

It’s a pretty loose definition but it covers all the typical Users but also some
of the groups I see ignored when we talk about users. These include:

*Your Support team* who will read your logs, code, and documentation to fix bugs
and improve the service.

*Your Service team* who will use your analytics, dashboards, and admin
interfaces to support the running of the service in live.

*Any Developers* building clients of your system who will be using your APIs to
provide business value to their company or customer

These people are often ignored in the consideration of a typical User. Any
stories written for them often get shoehorned into a more “typical” user need.

As I mentioned in [Rule 3 - Who-What-Why not Who-What-What] when you hide the
real reason, or in this case the real User, you prevent the team from fully
understanding the Need behind it.
