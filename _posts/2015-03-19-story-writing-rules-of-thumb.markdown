title: "Rules of thumb for writing Agile Stories"

How many times have you read the following:

    As a User
    I want to do the thing
    so that I have done the thing.

or:

    As the Accreditor
    I want to ensure you have done the thing
    so hackers can’t do this other thing.

or even:

    As the team
    I want some other team to do this thing
    so that our Users can use our thing.

If you work in an Agile team I guarantee you’ve seen those stories. You may even
have a set of them on the wall right now.

Over the last few months I’ve spent a lot of time helping run an Agile team. It
was my first real, in depth, experience in trying to build a backlog of User
Stories for a team. I gained some bad habits, made a lot of mistakes, and
learned a lot about writing stories.

So I've built a set of Rules of Thumb I often use when in Story Writing
workshops to help improve the quality and clarity of the stories we produce. I’m
not hard and fast on these rules but they do seem to improve the quality of
stories I write.

This stuff is hard. Really hard. So I’m not going to pretend I know what I’m
talking about, not even that I did the right thing, but having had some time to
think I’ve formed some rules of thumb that I’m starting to use to make my User
Stories better. Perhaps they’ll help.

There's a lot of content here, too much for one post, so I'll release them in
separate posts over the next few weeks.

I might be quite wrong on these. Please call me out on twitter or in the
comments if you see something you disagree with, it's the only way I will get
better at this.
