Having not blogged in a while I find it hard to know how to start. Dive in, I 
suppose...

I've just come back from a few days away in Lisbon with Roo and Colin, 
attending Web Summit 2016. It's the first really large conference I've attended 
and I'm not really certain what I had expected going in.

I've been left with thoughts racing round my head, a small scattering of notes 
from the talks I attended and a 3 hour flight to kill. So I'm going to write up 
my notes and get a few new posts up on this now dusty blog.

I'd also like to document my thoughts on Web Summit and how I found it. I went 
in with very little idea of what it would be like.
