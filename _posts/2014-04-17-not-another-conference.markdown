A few weeks ago during Kainos kickoff event I ran a
short unconference for our GOV Business Unit, the unit that focuses on
Government projects like the [Government Digital Services]  [Exemplar projects].

___TL;DR___ - It was great fun and well worth the time: [Photos],
[Session topics], notes from the sessions to come soon.

An un-conference is almost the opposite of a conference. A normal conference has
a set agenda of speakers that talk to an audience on topics they chose weeks or
months ago.

![Session planning underway] In an un-conference the agenda is chosen on the day
by the attendees voting on topics they themselves have proposed. The topics are
then assigned to areas or tables for a session and the attendees choose the one
that sounds most interesting to sit at. Everyone at the table is encouraged to
join in the group discussion and participate.

Usually at the end of each session someone from each group would give a two
minute recap of what the discussion led to, so anyone not involved can get the
gist and have a face to talk to if they’d like to continue the conversation.
We unfortunately didn’t have the time but will be publishing the notes taken
instead.

All of the session topics are available at <http://michaelallen.io/gov-bu-unconf>

## What I learned

### An hour isn’t long enough

Due to time constraints with the main kickoff event happening in the afternoon
we were forced to hold the event for only an hour. This gave enough time for 3
sessions of 15 to 20 mins each, with 6 tables at which to form groups. In total
we got conversation started on 18 topics and though it wasn’t long enough to
really go in depth on those I hope it started conversation flowing.

Next time, I’d like to take at least two hours and spread the voting and
suggesting portion through the day more.

### Everyone likes to participate

I was initially worried that it would be difficult to motivate people into
participating in an event that requires a lot of interaction to work,
especially given that this was the first time most of them had encountered the
unconference format.

The worry was completely unfounded, thankfully. After an initial “eh, how do we
start this?” at each table, everyone really got into the conversations and a
lot of ideas started flying across the tables.

### A great way to get to know people

![Thoughts from 4 offices around one table] The fairly loose structure allowed
you to get a real sense of the particpants; people I've barely seen in the last
few years due to the nature of working on site. It's this sense for the people
that builds culture, which is hard to get when you spend most days working
in another team's office.

### A great way to find out what you care about

The unconference was a great way to see what mattered to us, both as individuals
and as a group. The topics that came up tended to follow a couple of themes,
things we have all been thinking about and possibly haven't said loud enough for
everyone to hear.

#### ![What mattered to us]
The topics we discussed can be found at <http://michaelallen.io/gov-bu-unconf>
and write ups of the notes we took will come soon (I don't actually have the
pages).

Now we have an idea of what is important to us: culture, who Kainos is and how
to spread knowledge. The hope is we can address these points. One item that
came up was a disengagement with Yammer, so I've begun setting up a Kainos IRC
as an experiement to address that.

## Lets do it again

![Lets do it again] From the feedback I've heard most people had fun and I
really enjoyed the unconference. I would be incredibly excited to participate in
another, perhaps with less running around headless chicken style. So I'll be
trying to organise another soon and if anyone needs help setting one up give me
a bell and I'll gladly help.
