So I'm starting a blog. I'm not entirely sure why yet.

There are somethings I know that took me far too long to figure out, days of head scratching and hair pulling that could have been avoided if someone had written it down and explained it. So that's what I intend to do.

If even one person reads this and avoids those days of hair pulling then I'll have helped. And that will make me feel good inside. So yeah, selfish reasons.
