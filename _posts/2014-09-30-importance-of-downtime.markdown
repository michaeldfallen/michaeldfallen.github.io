I wrote this 2 months ago at the end of a long project. Now having recently
finished Alpha on a new project for DWP that was even more challenging...
I wish I had listened to my own advice.

So here’s the post unedited from what I wrote 2 months ago:

## The importance of downtime

I’ve just recently come off a large project that kept our team very busy for
the last 2½ years. It was a fantastic project, a fantastic group of people and
I loved working on something that felt like a certifiable “good thing”.

It was also quite hard.

When I started writing this blog I intended to try and write regularly, at least
once a month. But with the amount of time I spent on the project coming home at
night and programming or writing became less and less desirable. It’s been an
avenue of frustration for me, feeling like I should be able to do more with my
days but never finding the time.

![Room Dashboard]
Over the last month I’ve been on the “Bench” in Kainos waiting for my next
project to start. It’s given me some downtime and I can feel myself coming back
to normal. In that time I’ve explored new languages, built [meeting room dashboards]
for the office, built an [awesome SBT plugin], travelled to our other
offices and more. Having the time to work on stuff because I’m interested in it,
rather than because a scary deadline is looming down upon the team, has really
helped rejuvenate the mind.

So I’d like to make a proposal that we need to give ourselves downtime. One day
a month to work on something that interests us, or write a blog post, or fix
the way your ssh connections constantly drop out after 25 minutes could be
enough to stave off the dreaded spectre of burnout.
