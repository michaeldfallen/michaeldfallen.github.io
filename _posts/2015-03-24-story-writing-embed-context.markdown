    As a User I want…

What is the User doing? Why are they here? What is their motivation? Is the
kettle currently on?

There's a lot of context that “As a User” misses. Yet those three words flow out
of my mouth without a second thought. Using a Persona will help increase the
context but by abstracting the context away we can easily forget about it.

An example:

    As a User
    I want to give you my new address
    so that I don’t lose my pension

Why is the User giving us a new address? Who are they? What caused them to come
to us?

You can probably infer the context that is missing here, but this won't always
be the case. If we include the context explicitly we would get:

    As a pensioner who has recently moved house
    I want to give you my new address
    so that I don’t lose my pension

Much better.

This can be especially useful when you have a very complex process and the
specific need you are trying to document could be confused for being needed in a
different circumstance.

    As a conveyancer who is waiting for a change on the register
    I want to be notified of that change
    So that I can proceed with my case as soon as possible

Now there is little ambiguity over when the user would have this need and
everyone can better understand why exactly they have this need.
